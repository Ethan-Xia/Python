## Change Ancount in Tortoisegit
* what

I have logined [Coding]('https://coding.net/') ancount in TortoiseGit. Now I want to change the ancount and login [Git](https://github.com/) ancount to using it.

* How

It seems that don't need to change ancount in setting, jsut 'clone' a project from Git and then pull changed file!

Now I have changed the README.md, I must commit it to local repository!Successfully in test commit!

Notice that **commit** operation just commit change in **local repository**, but I want to I can see the change online, I need to pull project!

**Pull project** operation will uploading the project change to online!
