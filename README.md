## Change Ancount in Tortoisegit
* what

I have logined [Coding]('https://coding.net/') ancount in TortoiseGit. Now I want to change the ancount and login [Git](https://github.com/) ancount to using it.

* How

It seems that don't need to change ancount in setting, jsut 'clone' a project from Git and then pull changed file!

Now I have changed the README.md, I will try to pull it!

Successfully in test commit!
